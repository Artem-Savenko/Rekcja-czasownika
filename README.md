## About this project
I know that sometimes I use wrong verb reaction while speaking Polish, so I decided to design a helper application that would educate the user about correct verb reactions and examples of usage.

This was also a good occasion to test and improve my beginner Python knowledge.

## Installation
In order to use this program you must have Python installed and added to your PATH system variable.
Clone the repository and open the root folder with `README.md` file in it.
After that run command `python src/main.py`.

## Usage
Running the program always displays a welcome message at the launch.
Type in command `pomoc` in order to get more details on all available commands.
