## About this project
This project was developed solely to test and improve my beginner Python knowledge.
Long time ago I had this application idea that would help the user to learn Polish language. In Polish, in order to use a verb with a noun you have to modify the noun accordingly to verb's reaction (rekcja czasownika). I have noticed that a lot of people struggle with applying correct verb reaction, so I decided it would be a good application where you can add, modify and view Polish verbs with their reactions with some examples.

## Installation
In order to use this program you must have Python installed and added to your PATH system variable.
After that simply run command `python src/main.py`.

## Usage
When you run the program you will see instructions in Polish that will help you learn how to use this program.
